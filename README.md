# Predict-Sales-By-Census-Block

A brand wishes to expand into areas without existing locations. 
They have asked you to evaluate their current business in order to choose where to expand. 
You have pulled census and housing data at the county level, and joined with the average sales 
for that brand in each county. You have split the data into two datasets:

case1_existing.csv – Counties with a restaurant already
case1_new.csv – Counties without a restaurant
